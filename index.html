	<strong>Shaders-Plane</strong>


After we had define exactly how the idea of shaders work, and which are the primary concepts that we understand about computer, the process we are going to follow
would be to start making outputs on graphic structures at the same time that we understand and comprehend the mathematical structures that are going to provide us 
with the step by step to achieve visual representations and overall systematic representation of information and graphical relationships.

&\text{he computer runs all the graphics interfaces through the chips, which is nothing else but a bunch of} \\
&\text{organizers or sieves, that reorder the on's and off's from thousands and millions of switches, which only purpose} \\
&\text{is to direct and redirect or sieve, the electric current, electricity, the power, the force through } \\
&\text{to the desired path, so the idea here is not understand something so simple, this is basically changing a bulb} \\
&\text{and turn on the switch to check if it turn up or not, the idea here is visualize what it is the best way} \\
&\text{to change all the bulbs of an stadium capable to alocate 200.000 kThousands people, and not just change} \\
&\text{the bulbs but also change the wired system that runs through all of them, all of a sudem changing one bulb  } \\
&\text{seems like a really easy task.} \\
\\[5pt]
&\text{But why thinking this inmense and enormous, is necesary, I only need to plot a single sine function} \\
&\text{i could do it by hand, if doing such thing is that difficult I would prefer to do that, is maybe} \\
&\text{what you are thinking now, and yeah, you're in the freedom to do whatever you think is best, but if your} \\
&\text{idea is to think about something really specific, and really punctual, which requires you to learn} \\
&\text{about this particular type of things, about this specific and punctual ways to think, then yes, you got} \\
&\text{to start thinking very inmense, so thinking little is a little bit more simple.} \\
\\[5pt]

&\text{So now we begin, what are these sieves you'll be thinking, well, easy, sum this two numbers could be a sieve, } \\
&\text{substract this two numbers, could be another sieve, make this number equal to this other number, is anoother one,} \\
&\text{multiply, compare, divide, greater and less than, is another way to create ways to separate and filter information} \\
&\text{verify trueness, which means if the thing is true or false, and when I say thing I mean  1 is equal to 1, if yes then } \\
&\text{continue with the next things to do.}\\
\\[5pt]

&\text{so that`s basically computing in its purest form, thats all the computer does all the time, in many many many ways to }\\
&\text{reorganize summations, comparations, multiplication, evaluation, and also one of the most important ones, }\\
&\text{create new things, stablish new information, save information, or also save this number, save this information you are reading,}\\
&\text{maybe it is useful in the future.}\\
\\[5pt]

&\text{so that's basically doing computing, that's all a computer does, in many, maaanyyyy ways, different ways but }\\
&\text{at the end the same thing, at the end the same same same thing, so if you now know what's really going on }\\
&\text{how much of this things you could think of out a doing }\\
&\text{1 trillions}\\
&\text{1 quatrillions}\\
&\text{1 quintilloins}\\
&\text{1 or maybe you could just think that everything that is going around you, works like that}\\
&\text{that everything that goes in your reality works like that, that everything is a summation}\\
&\text{a substraction, a reorganization of data a store and load of information in very particular ways to make everything }\\                    
&\text{looks different but the same, at the same time, so maybe is life a simulation maybe you are reading letters that }\\
&\text{only appear in front of you when you are reading them, and everysingle time that you save something is only the illusion}\\
&\text{that you image yourself really doing something.}\\

&\text{so is a decaheptaoctasextaatrillion of things, doesnt sountd that big.}\\
\\[5pt]

&\text{so the idea behind computers or more specificly science, is that you could alter the things in reality}\\
&\text{if the things are organized in a correct order, or fashion, something that you can think is basically a }\\
&\text{representation of this amounts, this inmense number of operations}\\
\\[5pt]

&\text{so how much pixels are on a screen like 2 million ? yeah something like that right, 1920 * 1080}\\
&\text{really small, dont you think, but how many transistors are on a chip, like 10 billion}\\
&\text{but why 10 billion if I only got 2 million pixels, and that's where everything hides behind}\\
&\text{how many screens are really running on your chip, on your computer, how many screens }\\
&\text{are being sum at other things, compare, substracted, how many data on your screen can be presented}\\
&\text{in other strings, in oder words, in other numbers, how many screens are on your computer, }\\
&\text{or more clearer, how many screens can you handle, hey wait a minute I only use one screen what the hell }\\
&\text{are you talking about. Simple, suppose that you are on a cafe internet, the old ones, where people used to sit}\\
&\text{one next to the other, now if you follow this structure, could you simulate that expression on your screen}\\
&\text{it is possible to create an simulation on your computer using math and code to create a cafe}\\
&\text{internet, yes for sure, so if you can simulate computers in a computers, are you simmulating a computer}\\
&\text{or just making use of your computer more extended.}\\
\\[5pt]

&\text{thats usually the most difficult idea to get on, that within your computer there are more computers, }\\
&\text{that you could make use of, if you know how to work with them, so making use of this screens or computers }\\
&\text{is what you need to understand, how to make use of computer more throughfully, how to use computers}\\
&\text{to use more computers, like painting, or building houses, learn how to build houses today, so you could }\\
&\text{build more houses tomorrow, or painting, paint something today so you could make more paints in the future}\\
&\text{so imagine that within your computer there are hundres or thousands or millions of screens, that you could}\\
&\text{could use to display things on.}\\
\\[5pt]

&\text{you could display mathematical plots, like we are going to do from this moment on, or }\\
&\text{you could write words on it, or you could create pictures, or used to create diagrams}\\
&\text{to edit videos, to edit images, to simulate environments, to 3D expand multiple screens so}\\
&\text{you image yourself automatizing machines, design plans, chat or whichever you think is best}\\
&\text{but yeah you got hundrds of screens on your computer available to extend, achieve, and reach your goals,}\\
&\text{but overall try to accomplish what you choise.}\\

&\text{So if we understand now that every computer chip today, got thousands and thousands of computers, inside the }\\
&\text{the question, start to turns into what can you do to change this computers to do what you want to do}\\
&\text{now I got for you a question, can you link a computer to a pixel ?, can you place a single computer }\\
&\text{inside your pixel, can you place a computer inside 2 million pixels, the answer is yes but no,}\\
&\text{its is possible yes, it is currently working like that no, so what is really happening is that each pixel}\\
&\text{is link through a space in your computer chip that sends the information to the screen, once is all updated,}\\
&\text{but before the screen is updated there is a single computer with the rules that we specify above dedicated to}\\
&\text{each pixel.}\\
&\text{So why instead not only one computer to all the pixels?, well thats a nice question, and the answers is }\\
&\text{yes, that's how everything use to work in the past, when computers started, the main way how they used to }\\
&\text{handle the operation, was like that, but at time past, and everything start to get tighter and tighter then}\\
&\text{we start to notice; hey, you know what I can do the same thing I am doing with 1 single computer with 2 milloin }\\
&\text{of them, and even faster.}\\
&\text{The reason why is faster, is cuz compare things is slower than to make calculations, calculations is fast really}\\
&\text{fast!!, like super, super, fast. }\\
&\text{So, now you know got the idea of what we are going to do, we are going to perform calculation on multiple }\\
&\text{computers, at the same time, to graph, or plot things on the screen, thats the main goal, and the reason how, }\\

$$\begin{aligned}
&\text{So the idea here is to understand that every single computer is run by another computer, that a way for us to }\\
&\text{understand more computer was create more computers to make use of, so we got to invent a way to name this new }\\
&\text{computers so everything dont get messup in the process, so instead of detailing computers version 2,3,4,5....}\\
&\text{ we instead started to name them like shaders, cores, thread, parallelize, kernel, virtualize, and}\\
&\text{etc, etc, etc...}\\
&\text{instead imagine the computers using others computers in a different way, with the purpose to achieve a goal.}\\
&\text{now what we are going to do is define how we can make use of a version of computers names shaders}\\
&\text{which is the closets way to make use of the graphic structures.}\\
&\text{The director is the computer that runs the compiler, which is the programming language of your choice,}\\
&\text{and that allows you to create the layers between the chip and the GPU interface }\\
&\text{so this is going to be the first way to connect the two points, the CPU is the place where you are going}\\
&\text{to use this programming language, to use the layers to share information with your graphics card}\\
&\text{which is the one who would take care of the displaying of your plots, offcourse there is a way to make}\\
&\text{this in the CPU, but is more manageable to do that in the GPU.}\\
&\text{So the GPU is the one which can operate this idea of millions of computers in a more clearer way.}\\
&\text{the main language of your choice is going to be the one who is going to direct which computers}\\
&\text{at which times, and in which way they are going to behave.}\\
&\text{imagine as if you were running your program by launching a command run, but instead you are running programs}\\
&\text{inside a programming language, which create the communication between the next layer of abstraction}\\
&\\[5ex]


&\text{Launching the computers is the key cuz thats whats going to allow you to ordenate things a little bit }\\
&\text{more clearer, mathematics is the key, make use of mathematics is the main idea here, learn how to }\\
&\text{make use of the ways to graphics functions things is what we need to do.}\\
&\text{now what we are going to do is make use of shaders by setting this thing up only to run shaders}\\
&\text{just one shaders, and we are going to get exhaust to make use of this thing}\\
&\text{there's million of things that we could write on a shader.}\\
&\text{So we are going to project many things in shaders, so we could make really nice graph in the future.}\\
&\\[5ex]

&\text{What we now know about shaders is that they work as computers, but you also know that within a shader there are}\\
&\text{also hundreds of computers, them which run in parallel, which only mean that current-electricity runs through it}\\
&\text{making all the computers inside the shader to run at the same time, all the single computers running at the same}\\
&\text{time, every single computer executed at the same time, and we can make these high number of computers to work }\\
&\text{how we wanted, and how we can do that is the key point here, we got to understand them before hand; we got to}\\
&\text{learn how to make use of them so we can make use of them.}\\
&\text{The question here is how we can make thousands of mini computers inside the shader to work how we want,}\\
&\text{which means output what we want them to output.}\\

&\text{Now the only thing that miss is how to derive the cubic polinomial, which is understand from which place}\\
&\text{this formula came from.}\\
\end{aligned}$$
    

$$\begin{aligned}
&\textbf{1. The Constraints} \\
&\text{To derive the Smoothstep function for the interval } t \in [0,1], \\
&\text{we define four boundary conditions:} \\
\\
&\begin{aligned}
&\text{Start Position:} & S(0) &= 0 \\
&\text{End Position:}   & S(1) &= 1 \\
&\text{Start Velocity:} & S'(0) &= 0 \\
&\text{End Velocity:}   & S'(1) &= 0
\end{aligned} \\
\\
&\textbf{2. The Cubic Derivation} \\
&\text{We begin with a general cubic polynomial:} \\
&S(t) = at^3 + bt^2 + ct + d \\
\\
&\text{First, we find its derivative:} \\
&S'(t) = 3at^2 + 2bt + c \\
\\
&\text{Applying the initial constraints } (t=0): \\
&S(0) = a(0)^3 + b(0)^2 + c(0) + d = 0 \implies d = 0 \\
&S'(0) = 3a(0)^2 + 2b(0) + c = 0 \implies c = 0 \\
\\
&\text{Applying the boundary constraints } (t=1): \\
&S(1) = a(1)^3 + b(1)^2 = 1 \implies a + b = 1 \\
&S'(1) = 3a(1)^2 + 2b(1) = 0 \implies 3a + 2b = 0 \\
\\
&\textbf{3. Solving the System} \\
&\text{From the velocity equation:} \\
&2b = -3a \implies b = -1.5a \\
\\
&\text{Substituting } b \text{ into the position equation:} \\
&a + (-1.5a) = 1 \\
&-0.5a = 1 \implies a = -2 \\
\\
&\text{Solving for } b: \\
&b = -1.5(-2) \implies b = 3 \\
\\
&\textbf{4. Final Result} \\
&\text{Plugging the constants back into the original polynomial, we arrive at:} \\
&S(t) = 3t^2 - 2t^3
\end{aligned}$$


$$\\[15ex]$$
                
$$\begin{aligned}  
&\text{Other way to derive this function is by lerping between two specific functions.} \\

$$a = t^2 \quad (Ease\ In)$$

$$b = 2t - t^2  \quad (Ease\ Out)$$ 

$$\\[5ex]$$
        
$$\text{lerp}(a, b, t) = a + t(b - a)$$

$$\\[5ex]$$
    
$$S(t) = \underbrace{t^2}_{a} + t(\underbrace{(2t - t^2)}_{b} - \underbrace{t^2}_{a})$$

$$\\[5ex]$$
        
$$S(t) = t^2 + t((2t - t^2) - t^2)$$
        
$$\\[5ex]$$
        
$$S(t) = t^2 + t(2t - 2t^2)$$

$$\\[5ex]$$        

$$S(t) = t^2 + 2t^2 - 2t^3$$

$$\\[5ex]$$
